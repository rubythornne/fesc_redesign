Design #1

1. Will it take a little, lot, or absurd amount of work to build this feature/design? 
A. This would take minimal time.
2. Are there other options for similar result with less work?
A. There are several ways to do this, some not so good for responsive design.
3. Is it a good development choice? Do you have any concerns with it?
A. I don't have any concerns with this design, it is fairly simple and creates a unique design feel.
4. What would be the first dev step you would try when building? Ex: “Add border radius to curve the edges” or “Something with SVGs”. This doesn't have to be terribly specific, just do your best. 
A. I would start with an SVG file that I would apply .css to. This will be more responsive and better stay intact.

Design #2
1. Will it take a little, lot, or absurd amount of work to build this feature/design? 
A. This would take minimal time.
2. Are there other options for similar result with less work?
A. There are several ways to do this, some that are unnecessary workarounds, including JavaScript workarounds that would take longer to make than necesary.
3. Is it a good development choice? Do you have any concerns with it?
A. I don't have any concerns with this design, it is fairly simple and creates a unique design feel.
4. What would be the first dev step you would try when building? Ex: “Add border radius to curve the edges” or “Something with SVGs”. This doesn't have to be terribly specific, just do your best. 
A. I would start with adding the formacation HTML tags to the second button. I would use the .css border radius property to the buttons to make the edges round.

Design #3

1. Will it take a little, lot, or absurd amount of work to build this feature/design? 
A. This seems like a lot of work for filling out a simple form flow.
2. Are there other options for similar result with less work?
A. There are several ways to somewhat block a user from using the browser 'back' button, but they are not foolproof. The user can use several work around to get out of the domain.
3. Is it a good development choice? Do you have any concerns with it?
A. I think instead of trying to block the user from using the browser's 'back' button, the user can be presented with a friendly note reminding them to use the buttons on the page/rather than the browser buttons.
4. What would be the first dev step you would try when building? Ex: “Add border radius to curve the edges” or “Something with SVGs”. This doesn't have to be terribly specific, just do your best. 
A. I would provide the user with a friendly note asking them to use the navigation buttons on the webpage, rather than the browser buttons.
